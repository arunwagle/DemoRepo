Note:
Db2 Warehouse on Cloud – MPP Large Plan
There is actually an MPP Large size that is available – referred to as “super node” internally (and this is for SoftLayer only).
This size hasn’t been officially announced, nor mentioned in the Bluemix catalog but it is available for order if customers require very large (e.g. 100TB to PB sized) environments

Specifications (per node)
48 cores
1 TB RAM
4.4 TB of physical storage for user data (~ 13 TB of uncompressed user data assuming typical compression)
3.6 TB of physical storage for temporary data (~ 11 TB of uncompressed temporary data assuming typical compression)
Jumpstart & Accelerator programs available

# Deployment options : Bluemix Public vs. Bluemix Dedicated

- Public or Dedicated, Db2 Warehouse on Cloud is deployed on dedicated servers
- Bluemix Dedicated, Db2 Warehouse on Cloud is included in the private network for that environment
- Bluemix Dedicated is not required for private networking. Private networking for CDS services is available with the **IBM Cloud Integrated Analytics Environment (ICIAE)**
- Bluemix Dedicated required only if the plan is to expand to use other data services.
