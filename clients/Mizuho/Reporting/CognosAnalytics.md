### Optional Step- Create a package using IBM Cognos Framework Manager
- Using IBM Cognos Framework Manager, create packages that can be used to generate reports. 
- The main idea is to model your business using the concepts of Query Subjects, Dimensions and fact tables.
- You can design your model with access to specific group of users. For e.g CEO, CFO can see a different sets of data than BA.
- This will be mainly used to design your OLAP kind queries for reporting.
- Refer to [IBM Cognos Framework Manager](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/11.0.0/ug_fm.pdf )for more details.

### Create reports

- Some examples of common reports are "Crosstab reports", "Visualizations", "Maps", "Active Reports"
- Refer to docs [IBM Cognos Analytics - Reporting](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/documentation/docs/en/11.0.0/ug_cr_rptstd.pdf)
